Learn-python-with-this-project-MRAC-TERM2-Hardware-

INTRODUCTION :

This repo is used for IAAC students and faculty to learn Python and OpenCV through projects. The concepts and tools learned through these projects are fundamental for future python and opencv development. This repo is designed for the preparation of MRAC students as they are entering the second term of the MRAC programme which is dedicated to sensing.

DESCRIPTION:

This project serves as an opportunity for students with architectural background to learn Python. It assumes that the student is an absolute beginner and is used to teach the fundamental concepts of Python through a hands on approach. 

FEATURES :

#GOALS_OF_THE_EXERCISE
#1. CALCULATE ROOM AREA
#2  CHOOSE FLOORING MATERIAL
#3  CALCULATE TOTAL COST
#4  SAVE PROJECT DETAILS 

#1 Users input the length and width of the room.
The program calculates the total area in square feet.
#2 Choose Flooring Material
Users choose a material for the flooring from predefined options.
Each material has a cost per square foot.
#3 Calculate Total Cost
The program calculates the total cost based on the chosen material and room area.
#4 Save Project Details
Users can save the project details (dimensions, material, cost) to a file.

The project will be written as one script. The script calculates the cost of flooring for a room based on user input for dimensions and material choices. The program also allows users to save project details to a file. 

LEARNING OBJECTIVES : 

By completing this exercise, students will:

Learn basic Python syntax.
Understand variables and data types.
Work with conditional statements.
Use loops for repetitive tasks (if expanded).
Create and use functions.
Work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Learn basic file handling operations.

EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS :

Read error messages carefully; they often indicate the exact problem (e.g., syntax errors, missing libraries, or type mismatches). Use the stack trace to locate the line of code causing the error. Copy and paste the error onto google; many times the answer can be found immediately. Print Statements: Use print() statements to display the values of variables at different stages of the program to understand what's happening. Check Inputs: Verify that inputs (e.g., file paths, numbers) are correct and in the expected format. Break Down the Problem: Test 
small sections of the code in isolation to ensure they work before integrating them into the larger program.
